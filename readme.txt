1. To install the child theme, get the latest ZIP file from GitHub at https://github.com/vicchi/twentyten-vicchi and uncompress it. Copy or upload the twentyten-vicchi folder to the wp-content/themes folder on your web server.
2. Activate the theme. From the Dashboard, navigate to Appearance and then to Themes and click on the "Activate" link under the entry for Twenty Ten - Vicchi
3. The theme supports custom header image rotation. For this version this is currently hardcoded but may be configurable in a later release.
4. All header images should be in JPG format and placed in the /wp-content/themes/twentyten-vicchi/images/headers folder. Each header image should be sized at 940x198 (if they're larger they'll be scaled) and also have a thumbnail version, sized at 230x48 with '-thumbnail' appended to the image name.
